Project:  'Break Out Game'
Category: "Weekend Projects"


Controls:
          Keyboard: ArrowLeft - left
                    ArrowRight - right

          or you may use your mouse and the paddle with move along in the
          respective direction.


This is a simple, traditional 'Break Out Game', objective of game play is to
keep the ball from touching the 4th(lowest/bottom) wall, keeping it in play via
the other 3 walls(left/top/right) walls and with the paddle. As you keep the ball
in play your aim is to "hit" all of the blocks as this will result in a win.
If you allow the ball to touch the 4th wall 3 times, you will have lost all of your
lives at which point you will need to restart.

Personal objective:

As I continue on my path of refining my skills, and growing as a developer,
specifically within the realm of Js applications. I find it helpful to spend time
with projects large & small, novel & relative as a means to expand my understanding
of not only the language syntax but to understand the full range of application/
libraries which exist.

Through developing 'Break-out' I have refreshed my knowledge on the basics of
Canvas Manipulation as well as the logic behind simple 2D games. Although my
desire is not to become a game developer by any measure, I found this to be an
enjoyable & refreshing project, and I will lend my time towards working on more,
complex games in the future. I would like to try my hand at implementing a form of
AI either in a more robust version of 'Break-out' or another 2D game such as
'Snake' or 'Tetris'.
